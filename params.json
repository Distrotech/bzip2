{"name":"Bzip2","tagline":"","body":"\r\nThis is the README for bzip2/libzip2.\r\nThis version is fully compatible with the previous public releases.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis file is part of bzip2/libbzip2, a program and library for\r\nlossless, block-sorting data compression.\r\n\r\nbzip2/libbzip2 version 1.0.6 of 6 September 2010\r\nCopyright (C) 1996-2010 Julian Seward <jseward@bzip.org>\r\n\r\nPlease read the WARNING, DISCLAIMER and PATENTS sections in this file.\r\n\r\nThis program is released under the terms of the license contained\r\nin the file LICENSE.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComplete documentation is available in Postscript form (manual.ps),\r\nPDF (manual.pdf) or html (manual.html).  A plain-text version of the\r\nmanual page is available as bzip2.txt.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD -- UNIX\r\n\r\nType 'make'.  This builds the library libbz2.a and then the programs\r\nbzip2 and bzip2recover.  Six self-tests are run.  If the self-tests\r\ncomplete ok, carry on to installation:\r\n\r\nTo install in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/man and\r\n/usr/local/include, type\r\n\r\n   make install\r\n\r\nTo install somewhere else, eg, /xxx/yyy/{bin,lib,man,include}, type\r\n\r\n   make install PREFIX=/xxx/yyy\r\n\r\nIf you are (justifiably) paranoid and want to see what 'make install'\r\nis going to do, you can first do\r\n\r\n   make -n install                      or\r\n   make -n install PREFIX=/xxx/yyy      respectively.\r\n\r\nThe -n instructs make to show the commands it would execute, but not\r\nactually execute them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD -- UNIX, shared library libbz2.so.\r\n\r\nDo 'make -f Makefile-libbz2_so'.  This Makefile seems to work for\r\nLinux-ELF (RedHat 7.2 on an x86 box), with gcc.  I make no claims\r\nthat it works for any other platform, though I suspect it probably\r\nwill work for most platforms employing both ELF and gcc.\r\n\r\nbzip2-shared, a client of the shared library, is also built, but not\r\nself-tested.  So I suggest you also build using the normal Makefile,\r\nsince that conducts a self-test.  A second reason to prefer the\r\nversion statically linked to the library is that, on x86 platforms,\r\nbuilding shared objects makes a valuable register (%ebx) unavailable\r\nto gcc, resulting in a slowdown of 10%-20%, at least for bzip2.\r\n\r\nImportant note for people upgrading .so's from 0.9.0/0.9.5 to version\r\n1.0.X.  All the functions in the library have been renamed, from (eg)\r\nbzCompress to BZ2_bzCompress, to avoid namespace pollution.\r\nUnfortunately this means that the libbz2.so created by\r\nMakefile-libbz2_so will not work with any program which used an older\r\nversion of the library.  I do encourage library clients to make the\r\neffort to upgrade to use version 1.0, since it is both faster and more\r\nrobust than previous versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD -- Windows 95, NT, DOS, Mac, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult for me to support compilation on all these platforms.\r\nMy approach is to collect binaries for these platforms, and put them\r\non the master web site (http://www.bzip.org).  Look there.  However\r\n(FWIW), bzip2-1.0.X is very standard ANSI C and should compile\r\nunmodified with MS Visual C.  If you have difficulties building, you\r\nmight want to read README.COMPILATION.PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\nAt least using MS Visual C++ 6, you can build from the unmodified\r\nsources by issuing, in a command shell: \r\n\r\n   nmake -f makefile.msc\r\n\r\n(you may need to first run the MSVC-provided script VCVARS32.BAT\r\n so as to set up paths to the MSVC tools correctly).\r\n\r\n\r\nVALIDATION\r\n\r\nCorrect operation, in the sense that a compressed file can always be\r\ndecompressed to reproduce the original, is obviously of paramount\r\nimportance.  To validate bzip2, I used a modified version of Mark\r\nNelson's churn program.  Churn is an automated test driver which\r\nrecursively traverses a directory structure, using bzip2 to compress\r\nand then decompress each file it encounters, and checking that the\r\ndecompressed data is the same as the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read and be aware of the following:\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\n\r\n   This program and library (attempts to) compress data by \r\n   performing several non-trivial transformations on it.  \r\n   Unless you are 100% familiar with *all* the algorithms \r\n   contained herein, and with the consequences of modifying them, \r\n   you should NOT meddle with the compression or decompression \r\n   machinery.  Incorrect changes can and very likely *will* \r\n   lead to disastrous loss of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\n\r\n   I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE\r\n   USE OF THIS PROGRAM/LIBRARY, HOWSOEVER CAUSED.\r\n\r\n   Every compression of a file implies an assumption that the\r\n   compressed file can be decompressed to reproduce the original.\r\n   Great efforts in design, coding and testing have been made to\r\n   ensure that this program works correctly.  However, the complexity\r\n   of the algorithms, and, in particular, the presence of various\r\n   special cases in the code which occur with very low but non-zero\r\n   probability make it impossible to rule out the possibility of bugs\r\n   remaining in the program.  DO NOT COMPRESS ANY DATA WITH THIS\r\n   PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER\r\n   SMALL, THAT THE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE.\r\n\r\n   That is not to say this program is inherently unreliable.  \r\n   Indeed, I very much hope the opposite is true.  bzip2/libbzip2 \r\n   has been carefully constructed and extensively tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENTS:\r\n\r\n   To the best of my knowledge, bzip2/libbzip2 does not use any \r\n   patented algorithms.  However, I do not have the resources \r\n   to carry out a patent search.  Therefore I cannot give any \r\n   guarantee of the above statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 0.9.0 (as compared to 0.1pl2) ?\r\n\r\n   * Approx 10% faster compression, 30% faster decompression\r\n   * -t (test mode) is a lot quicker\r\n   * Can decompress concatenated compressed files\r\n   * Programming interface, so programs can directly read/write .bz2 files\r\n   * Less restrictive (BSD-style) licensing\r\n   * Flag handling more compatible with GNU gzip\r\n   * Much more documentation, i.e., a proper user manual\r\n   * Hopefully, improved portability (at least of the library)\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 0.9.5 ?\r\n\r\n   * Compression speed is much less sensitive to the input\r\n     data than in previous versions.  Specifically, the very\r\n     slow performance caused by repetitive data is fixed.\r\n   * Many small improvements in file and flag handling.\r\n   * A Y2K statement.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.0 ?\r\n\r\n   See the CHANGES file.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.2 ?\r\n\r\n   See the CHANGES file.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.3 ?\r\n\r\n   See the CHANGES file.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.4 ?\r\n\r\n   See the CHANGES file.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.5 ?\r\n\r\n   See the CHANGES file.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.6 ?\r\n\r\n   See the CHANGES file.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you find bzip2 useful.
